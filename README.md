## 🧑‍💻 About Me  

I started my journey in tech as a **Web Developer** during my university years, building small projects and learning the fundamentals of programming.  
Later, I transitioned into **Quality Assurance**, where I discovered my passion for testing, finding bugs, and ensuring that products meet the highest quality standards.  

Throughout my career, I have worked in **Agile environments** with cross-functional teams, contributing to financial and enterprise-level projects.  
Some highlights of my journey include:  
- ✅ Leading QA efforts in projects, representing the QA team and ensuring product quality before release.  
- ✅ Hands-on experience with **API Testing (Postman, SQL queries)** and **Web Automation (Playwright with TypeScript)**.  
- ✅ Strong background in **functional testing**, regression, and exploratory testing.  
- ✅ Supporting teams by improving QA processes and maintaining a focus on quality delivery.
